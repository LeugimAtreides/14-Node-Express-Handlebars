# 14-Node-Express-Handlebars
In this assignment, I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORMs. I followed the MVC design pattern; used Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

<h1>C.R.U.D at Heart</h1>
<br>
At its core this application, although whimsical, is meant to show the knowledge I've gained in Express, mySQL, Node, Handlebars, and the use of the MVC design pattern to build an application that creates data, reads it, updates it, and deletes it all while doing it dynamically.

<h1>Eat Da Burger</h1>
In the application one can choose a burger and when the user clicks the consume button it will delete it from one list and put it into the "devoured" list. The user can also insert their own burgers into the list and update them to be devoured as well.

<h1>Ice-Box and Beyond</h1>
There are some wishlist items for this application.
<ol>
<li>Add GIPHY functionality so that a funny GIF appears whenever the user consumes a burger</li>
<li>Add dynamic sound effects that will play in certain conditions(e.g. a chicken clucking if its a chicken sandwhich, or disgusted sounds if the burger has non-traditional ingredients)</li>
<li>Animation capacity</li>
</ol>
